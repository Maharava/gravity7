Player plays as a civilisation, begining with an OUTPOST. Through the Outpost, the player can design and construct BUILDINGS and SHIPS with which to expand to other planets. Control will be completely through the keyboard.
To navigate around, the player can view their Outposts or view planets in the system. Locations, to view or interact with, are arranged as SUPER Locations, LOCATIONS and SUB Locations. SUPER Locations are the star system, with Locations generally being a planet or asteroid belt, with the SUB locations being a planets moons or Outposts upon it. Player Outposts are always considered Locations.
Once a new location has been selected, actions avaliable there will become avaliable. These actions depend on the location and what you're doing - for example, a fleet of ships may have 'ATTACK', 'ORBIT', 'DROP OFF CARGO' etc as options.

OUTPOSTS
Outposts are cities, countries, bases, etc. An outpost is deisgnated by the placement or construction of an Outpost Command. This building is upgraded and changed as the player wishes, providing boosts to the Outpost. For example, turning it to a Government Office boosts population growth and tax revenue, while a Scienctific Outpost will boost the science output of the Outpost. The type of Outpost Command will not restrict placement of ofther buildings - that is, a Scientific Outpost may still have mines and defenses placed all around it.
The Outpost data Structure contain Population, Population Growth, Max Population, Tax Revenue, Science Bonus, Mining Bonus, Defense Bonus, and so on. They also hold an array called buildings, which can store 500 entries, which should be far more than any player needs. This array holds the buildings used, much like the sys.bodies[] array
